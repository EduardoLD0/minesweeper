# minesweeper
A python program that makes a simplistic version of the game "Minesweeper".

This was made using the graphics.py library, an open-source library released under the terms of the GPL. You can find the library at https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py.

Currently, this game lacks:

- Lose when a mine is found
- Flag system
